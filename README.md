Using brain tumor images acquired from an optical fluorescence microscope imaging system employing a 488 nanometer Argon laser, this project used the Otsu algorithm to highlight cancerous brain tissue segments, facilitating faster and more accurate diagnoses of brain cancer while providing a surgeon with more accurate images to reduce the possibility of healthy tissue removal during brain cancer operations.
